<h3>Lead Mobile Engineer (Machine Learning / Computer Vision Focus)</h3>

<p>The laboratory of Shamim Nemati at Emory School of Medicine is looking for a driven mobile engineer to head up mobile application development in our technology team on the <a href="projects/autism-therapy-on-glass.html">Autism Glass Project.</a> </p>

<h4>Primary Purpose</h4>

<p>You should have a strong background in computer science, systems, and mobile application development. You don’t rely on a UI design contractor to get you a PSD of what the app is supposed to look like. You love user interfaces and user experience design. You can design good architectures where it’s necessary, but you’re enough of a hacker to get the job done. Ideally, you’ve also developed some low-level software tools and understand what it means to do heavy computation in C++ on a low-powered mobile device. Finally, you’re tremendously excited about building an application that helps kids with Autism recognize social cues.</p>

<p>Ideal candidates for this position have built several Android applications and at least one iOS app, are familiar with low-level tools like the NDK.</p>

<h4>Required Experience:</h4>

<ul>
<li>  Mobile development experience on iOS and Android in Objective-C, Java, and using the Android NDK</li>
<li>  Excited to develop on new platforms</li>
<li>  Understanding of networking protocols</li>
<li>  Track record of shipping and scaling products in a non-research setting</li>
<li>  Excellent engineering communication skills</li>
<li>  Comfortable in a Unix environment with common developer tools</li>
</ul>

<h4>Desired:</h4>

<ul>
<li>  GPU Programming experience</li>
<li>  At least one scripting language and a basic understanding of processing large datasets</li>
<li>  Basic knowledge of image processing, machine learning, and computer vision and familiarity with OpenCV</li>
</ul>
