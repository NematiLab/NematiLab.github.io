pages={1356-64}, 
abstract={We present a non-parametric adaptive surrogate test that allows for the differentiation of statistically significant TWave Alternans (TWA) from alternating patterns that can be solely explained by the statistics of noise. The proposed test is based on estimating the distribution of noise induced alternating patterns in a beat sequence from a set of surrogate data derived from repeated reshuffling of the original beat sequence. Thus, in assessing the significance of the observed alternating patterns in the data no assumptions are made about the underlying noise distribution. In addition, since the distribution of noise-induced alternans magnitudes is calculated separately for each sequence of beats within the analysis window, the method is robust to data non-stationarities in both noise and TWA. The proposed surrogate method for rejecting noise was compared to the standard noise rejection methods used with the Spectral Method (SM) and the Modified Moving Average (MMA) techniques. Using a previously described realistic multi-lead model of TWA, and real physiological noise, we demonstrate the proposed approach reduces false TWA detections, while maintaining a lower missed TWA detection compared with all the other methods tested. A simple averaging-based TWA estimation algorithm was coupled with the surrogate significance testing and was evaluated on three public databases; the Normal Sinus Rhythm Database (NRSDB), the Chronic Heart Failure Database (CHFDB) and the Sudden Cardiac Death Database (SCDDB). Differences in TWA amplitudes between each database were evaluated at matched heart rate (HR) intervals from 40 to 120 beats per minute (BPM). Using the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, we found that significant differences in TWA levels exist between each patient group at all decades of heart rates. The most marked difference was generally found at higher heart rates, and the new technique resulted in a larger margin of separability between patient populations than w- hen the SM or MMA were applied to the same data.},

 electrocardiogram (ECG) and is associated with the mechanisms leading
 to sudden cardiac death (SCD). In this study, we propose the use
 of a multilead TWA analysis scheme that combines the Laplacian likelihood
 ratio (LLR) method and periodic component analysis (piCA), an eigenvalue
 decomposition technique whose aim is to extract the most periodic
 sources of the signal. The proposed scheme is evaluated in different
 scenarios-from synthetic signals to stress test ECGs-and is compared
 to other reported schemes based on the LLR method. Results demonstrate
 that the piCA-based scheme provides a superior ability to detect
 TWA than previously reported schemes, and has the potential to improve
 the prognostic value of testing for TWA.},

  abstract={We present generalizations of our previously published artificial models for generating multi-channel ECG to provide simulations of abnormal cardiac rhythms. Using a three-dimensional vectorcardiogram (VCG) formulation, we generate the normal cardiac dipole for a patient using a sum of Gaussian kernels, fitted to real VCG recordings. Abnormal beats are specified either as perturbations to the normal dipole or as new dipole trajectories. Switching between normal and abnormal beat types is achieved using a first-order Markov chain. Probability transitions can be learned from real data or modeled by coupling to heart rate and sympathovagal balance. Natural morphology changes from beat-to-beat are incorporated by varying the angular frequency of the dipole as a function of the inter-beat (RR) interval. The RR interval time series is generated using our previously described model whereby time- and frequency-domain heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability characteristics can be specified. QT-HR hysteresis is simulated by coupling the Gaussian kernels associated with the T-wave in the model with a nonlinear factor related to the local HR (determined from the last n RR intervals). Morphology changes due to respiration are simulated by introducing a rotation matrix couple to the respiratory frequency. We demonstrate an example of the use of this model by simulating HR-dependent T-wave alternans (TWA) with and without phase-switching due to ectopy. Application of our model also reveals previously unreported effects of common TWA estimation methods.}

abstract = {Standard heart rate variability (HRV) techniques have been questioned in the sleep and autonomic fields as imprecise measures of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity. A new technique has emerged, known as phase-rectified signal averaging (PRSA). PRSA is used to quantify the quasi-periodic accelerations and decelerations in short-term heart rate, an effect that is normally masked by artifacts and noise. When applied to a signal of peak-to-peak (RR) time intervals, these quasiperiodicities can be used to estimate overall vagal activity, quantified as deceleration capacity (DC) and acceleration capacity (AC). We applied the PRSA analysis to a healthy cohort (ages 21-60 yr) enrolled in a clinical sleep trial, in which ECG data during wakefulness and sleep were available. We found that DC and AC were significantly attenuated with increasing age: a 0.27 ms/yr decrease in DC and a 0.29 ms/yr increase in AC (P < 0.001). However, even in the older subjects, DC values were higher then previously found in people post-myocardial infarction. We also found a drop in percentage of normal-to-normal intervals where the current interval deviated >50 ms from the previous interval with age, with a decrease of 0.84%/yr. We did not find any differences between younger and older subjects with traditional HRV techniques, such as low-frequency or high-frequency power. Overall, the study provides normative PRSA data and suggests that PRSA is more sensitive than other HRV measurements. We propose that the decrease in DC and AC may be a sensitive marker for autonomic changes with aging. Further work will be required to determine whether the observed changes predict poorer cardiac health prognosis.

abstract={ Detection and classification of ventricular complexes from the ECG is of considerable importance in Holter and critical care patient monitoring, being essential for the timely diagnosis of dangerous heart conditions. Accurate detection of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) is particularly important in relation to life-threatening arrhythmias. In this paper, we introduce a model-based dynamic algorithm for tracking the ECG characteristic waveforms using an extended Kalman filter. The algorithm can work on single or multiple leads. A ``polargram'' (a polar representation of the signal) is introduced, which is constructed using the Bayesian estimations of the state variables. The polargram allows the specification of a polar envelope for normal rhythms. Moreover, we propose a novel measure of signal fidelity by monitoring the covariance matrix of the innovation signals throughout the filtering procedure. PVCs are detected by simultaneous tracking the signal fidelity and the polar envelope. Five databases, including 40 records from MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, are used for differentiating normal, PVC, and other beats. Performance evaluation results show that the proposed method has an average detection accuracy of 99.10\%, aggregate sensitivity of 98.77\%, and aggregate positive predictivity of 97.47\%. Furthermore, the method is capable of 100\% accuracy for records that contain only PVCs and normal sinus beats. The results illustrate that the method can contribute to, and enhance the performance of clinical PVC detection. },

ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:Within the intensive care unit (ICU), arterial blood pressure (ABP) is typically recorded at different (and sometimes uneven) sampling frequencies, and from different sensors, and is often corrupted by different artifacts and noise which are often non-Gaussian, nonlinear and nonstationary. Extracting robust parameters from such signals, and providing confidences in the estimates is therefore difficult and requires an adaptive filtering approach which accounts for artifact types.METHODS:Using a large ICU database, and over 6000 hours of simultaneously acquired electrocardiogram (ECG) and ABP waveforms sampled at 125 Hz from a 437 patient subset, we documented six general types of ABP artifact. We describe a new ABP signal quality index (SQI), based upon the combination of two previously reported signal quality measures weighted together. One index measures morphological normality, and the other degradation due to noise. After extracting a 6084-hour subset of clean data using our SQI, we evaluated a new robust tracking algorithm for estimating blood pressure and heart rate (HR) based upon a Kalman Filter (KF) with an update sequence modified by the KF innovation sequence and the value of the SQI. In order to do this, we have created six novel models of different categories of artifacts that we have identified in our ABP waveform data. These artifact models were then injected into clean ABP waveforms in a controlled manner. Clinical blood pressure (systolic, mean and diastolic) estimates were then made from the ABP waveforms for both clean and corrupted data. The mean absolute error for systolic, mean and diastolic blood pressure was then calculated for different levels of artifact pollution to provide estimates of expected errors given a single value of the SQI.RESULTS:Our artifact models demonstrate that artifact types have differing effects on systolic, diastolic and mean ABP estimates. We show that, for most artifact types, diastolic ABP estimates are less noise-sensitive than mean ABP estimates, which in turn are more robust than systolic ABP estimates. We also show that our SQI can provide error bounds for both HR and ABP estimates.CONCLUSION:The KF/SQI-fusion method described in this article was shown to provide an accurate estimate of blood pressure and HR derived from the ABP waveform even in the presence of high levels of persistent noise and artifact, and during extreme bradycardia and tachycardia. Differences in error between artifact types, measurement sensors and the quality of the source signal can be factored into physiological estimation using an unbiased adaptive filter, signal innovation and signal quality measures.},

abstract = {Background: Low tidal volume ventilation for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a well accepted concept. However, controversy persists regarding the optimal ventilator settings for ventilated patients without ARDS. This study tested the hypothesis that ventilator settings influence the development of new ARDS.  MethodsRetrospective analysis of patients from the MIMIC-II database who were mechanically ventilated for [&ge;] 48 hours between 2001 and 2005.  Results: 2583 patients required greater than 48 hrs of ventilation. Of 789 patients who did not have ARDS at admission, 152 (19%) went on to develop ARDS. Univariate analysis revealed high peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) (OR 1.53 per standard deviation, 95% confidence interval 1.28 - 1.84), increasing PEEP (OR 1.35 per SD, 95%CI 1.15 - 1.58) and tidal volume (OR 1.36 per SD, 95%CI 1.12 - 1.64) to be significant risk factors. Major non-ventilator risk factors for ARDS included sepsis, low pH, elevated lactate, low albumin, transfusion of packed red blood cells, transfusion of plasma, high net fluid balance, and low respiratory compliance. Multivariable logistic regression showed that peak pressure (OR 1.31 per SD, 95%CI 1.08 - 1.59), high net fluid balance (OR 1.3 per SD, 95%CI 1.09 - 1.56), transfusion of plasma (OR 1.26 per SD, 95%CI 1.07 - 1.49), sepsis (OR 1.57, 95%CI 1.00 - 2.45) and tidal volume (OR 1.29 per SD, 95%CI 1.02 - 1.52) were significantly associated with the development of ARDS.  Conclusions: The associations between the development of ARDS and clinical interventions, including high airway pressures, high tidal volume, positive fluid balance and transfusion of blood products, suggests that ARDS may be a preventable complication in some cases.

This manuscript provides an overview of this "de-identification challenge", describes the data and the annotation process, explains the evalua-tion metrics, discusses the nature of the systems that addressed the challenge, and analyzes the results of received system runs. The challenge data consisted of discharge summaries drawn from the Partners Healthcare system. Authors prepared this data for the challenge by replacing authentic PHI with synthe-sized surrogates. To focus the challenge on non-dictionary-based de-identification methods, the data was enriched with out-of-vocabulary PHI surrogates, i.e., made up names. The data also included some PHI surrogates that were ambiguous with medical non-PHI terms. A total of seven teams participated in the challenge. Each team submitted up to three system runs, for a total of sixteen submissions. The authors used precision, recall, and F-measure to evaluate the submitted system runs based on their token-level and instance-level performance on the ground truth. The systems with the best performance scored above 98\% in F-measure for all categories of identifiers. Most out-of-vocabulary PHI could be identified accurately. However, identifying ambiguous PHI proved challenging. The performance of systems on the test data set is encouraging. Future evaluations of these systems will involve larger data sets from more heterogeneous sources.

  pages={629-643},
  year={2004},
  abstract={This paper proposes principles and methods for assessing the robustness of ST segment analysers and algorithms. We describe an evaluation protocol, procedures and performance measures suitable for assessing the robustness. An ST analyser is robust if its performance is not critically dependent on the variation of the noise content of input signals and on the choice of the database used for testing, and if its analysis parameters are not critically tuned to the database used for testing. The protocol to assess the robustness includes: (1) a noise stress test addressing the aspect of variation of input signals; (2) a bootstrap evaluation of algorithm performance addressing the aspect of distribution of input signals and (3) a sensitivity analysis addressing the aspect of variation of analyser's architecture parameters. An ST analyser is considered to be robust if the performance measurements obtained during these procedures remain above the predefined critical performance boundaries. We illustrate the use of the robustness protocol and robustness measures by a case study in which we assessed the robustness of our Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve transform based ischaemic ST episode detection and quantification algorithm using the European Society of Cardiology ST-T database.}

calculated using data from 30 women who had a fetal scalp electrode
placed for a clinical indication, and compared to the assessment of
FHR variability from four perinatologists who interpreted paper
tracings of the same data. Inter-rater reliability was calculated and
receiver-operator curve analysis was done. Results. Correlation
between the computer algorithm's assessment of variability and the
perinatologists' assessment (0.27-0.68) was similar to the inter-rater
reliability between perinatologists (0.33-0.72). Conclusions. A
computer-based algorithm can assess FHR variability as well as expert
clinicians.}

Although ST changes provide a sensitive indicator of ischemia, a variety of non-ischemic mechanisms can also result in ST changes, so that ECG-based diagnosis of ischemia is regarded as non-specific and unreliable. It may be possible, by study of the dynamics of ST changes, to improve the specificity of ECG criteria consistent with ischemia. The fourth annual PhysioNet/Computers in Cardiology Challenge encouraged participants to develop and evaluate methods for distinguishing ischemic and non-ischemic ST changes using a standard, meticulously annotated data set.

abstract={An important challenge in data mining is in identifying "similar" temporal patterns that may illuminate hidden information in a database of time series. We are actively engaged in the development of a temporal database of several thousand ICU patient records that contains time-varying physiologic measurements recorded over each patient's ICU stay. The discovery of multiparameter temporal patterns that are predictive of physiologic instability may aid clinicians in optimizing care for critically-ill patients.In this paper, we introduce a novel temporal similarity metric based on a transformation of time series data into an intuitive symbolic representation. The symbolic transform is based on a wavelet decomposition to characterize time series dynamics at multiple time scales. The symbolic transformation allows us to utilize classical information retrieval algorithms based on a vector-space model. Our algorithm is capable of assessing the similarity between multi-dim!
 ensional time series and is computationally efficient.We utilized our algorithm to identify similar physiologic patterns in hemodynamic time series from ICU patients. The results of this study demonstrate that similarities between different patient time series may have meaningful physiologic interpretations in the detection of impending hemodynamic deterioration. Thus, our framework may be of potential use in clinical decision-support systems. As a generalized time series similarity metric, the algorithms that are described have applications in several other domains as well.},

        Abstract = {Abstract: In the modern intensive care unit (ICU), the physiologic state of critically-ill patients is monitored through a diverse array of biosensors and laboratory measurements. The sheer volume of data that is collected has overwhelmed clinicians charged with assimilating and transforming the data into clinical hypotheses. The development of automated algorithms with vigilant monitoring and clinical decision-support capabilities would help to alleviate this "information-overload" challenge. The inherent noise and measurement error is an added level of complication to the real-time analysis and interpretation of medical data. One class of "noise" in medical data can be characterized by the absence or unavailability of a desired measurement. We have analyzed a large collection of clinical laboratory data (blood chemistry, blood gasses, complete blood counts) from over 600 ICU/CCU patients in the MIMIC II database. An analysis of the frequency of missing !
 data values across patient records for each measurement was completed. Furthermore, we have developed a novel method to estimate the values of missing data by the use of a weighted K-nearest neighbors algorithm. We propose a weighting scheme that exploits the correlation between a "missing" dimension and available data values from other fields. We compare our technique with several popular missing value estimation techniques: principal components analysis, least squares estimation, mean imputation, and classical k-nearest neighbors. The mean standardized imputation error ranges from a minimum of 0.31 to a maximum, of 0.75 depending on the imputed dimension. The mean standardized imputation error over all dimensions is 0.45.},

author={Janz, B. A. and Saeed, M. and Frassica, J. and Clifford, G. D. and Mark, R. G.},
journal={AMIA Annu Symp Proc},
year={2005},
abstract={Introduction The goal of this research project is to design and optimize a novel critical care alert and display (CCAD) system to assist decision support in the ICU using a massive temporal ICU patient research database [1]. The CCAD system will generate and display abnormal clinical values (Alerts) to the clinician through a user interface designed to allow for the efficient display of data. Background Patients admitted to ICUs are generally physiologically labile and require close monitoring, which results in the accumulation of a large amount of physiologic data. This accumulation of data can lead to an overload of information especially for young physicians caring for these patients. It is essential to have the ability to view and display this information in a concise manner to optimize patient care. Being able to review a large amount of chronological information in a short period of time might help the clinician better evaluate the state of a patient in the ICU. System Design The CCAD system was designed using the MIMIC II database which is a robust fully de-identified temporal ICU research database recorded from patients in the MICU, SICU, and CCU at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA [1]. The software program was written using C-sharp and compiled in the Microsoft Visual Studio .NET(tm) environment. The search engine accesses a set of relational databases and sends abnormal values to a Microsoft ACCESS(tm) database. The graphical user interface imports data from the ACCESS(tm) database and displays the abnormal values to the clinician. The clinician can then select an abnormal value and display the trend using a variety of different graphical tools. Results The search engine and the clinician GUI were both created off-line using the MIMIC II research database [1], which allowed clinicians to assist with the design of the system without altering real-time data or viewing protected health information. Histograms were generated to evaluate the frequency of abnormal values per ICU patient day. 2000 patients were selected from the MIMIC II database. Sixty different common ICU parameters were specified for analysis. For these parameters, there were a total of 56 abnormal values (alerts) generated per patient ICU day. For a 20 bed ICU, that would equate to 1127 total alerts per ICU patient day. When looking specifically at the complete blood count (CBC), 2.9 alerts were generated per ICU patient day.}

        Abstract = {Abstract: Development and evaluation of intensive care unit (ICU) decision-support systems would be greatly facilitated by the availability of a large-scale ICU patient database. Following our previous efforts with the MIMIC (Multi-parameter Intelligent Monitoring for Intensive Care) Database, we have leveraged advances in networking and storage technologies to develop a far more massive temporal database, MIMIC II. MIMIC II is an ongoing effort: data is continuously and prospectively archived from all ICU patients in our hospital. MIMIC II now consists of over 800 ICU patient records including over 120 gigabytes of data and is growing. A customized archiving system was used to store continuously up to four waveforms and 30 different parameters from ICU patient monitors. An integrated user-friendly relational database was developed for browsing of patients' clinical information (lab results, fluid balance, medications, nurses' progress notes). Based upon its unprecedented size and scope, MIMIC II will prove to be an important resource for intelligent patient monitoring research, and will support efforts in medical data mining and knowledge-discovery.},
